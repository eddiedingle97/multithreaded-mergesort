# multithreaded-mergesort

this was built in Ubuntu 20.04, I cannot guarantee this will work for any other operating system

to build type "make" in the directory

for instructions on how to run type "./sort -h"

I am mostly satisfied with this project, it can currently sort around 2,000,000 numbers before seg faulting due to stack depth, may add code to increase that later

reading from a file is very slow, and the actual sort is a very small fraction of time
